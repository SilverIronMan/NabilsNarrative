While I was at Bivee, I was the project lead for the <a href="http://conference2015.diversitywoman.com/">2015 Diversity Woman Conference</a> Website.

Additionally, soon after I was hired, Bivee was hired as a consultant for the World Bank. I helped increase the functionality of one of their sites by working on their search function and implementing load more buttons.
