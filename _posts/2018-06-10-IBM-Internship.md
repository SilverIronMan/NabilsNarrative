introduction: My summer internship with IBM
---

During the summer after my junior year in college, I worked as an intern for IBM. While the code that I wrote for them is proprietary, I did attempt to at least partially remake some of the things that I worked on for them. This can be seen in the interactive tree hierarchy that I worked on to show how my team was organized.
