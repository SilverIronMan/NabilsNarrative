introduction: Affiliated Creditors Project
---

Affiliated Creditors is a debt collection company. Most of their clients are hospitals which have medical debt. Their clients require Affiliated Creditors to maintain a high degree of respect for their clients so as to not hurt their brand image. In order to accomplish this goal, some means of quality assurance for their clients is required. Before I was hired, the company had someone to review all the calls being made. However, this process is rather time consuming and, thereby, doesnâ€™t enable enough oversight as not all calls get to be reviewed. In order to solve this problem, I was hired to create a system using IBM Watson to generate executive reports on each call. With the reports generated, the company can ensure collection quality by assisting collectors who do not meet the standard.

However, before the project, could reach its conclusion, the person who hired me was fired and the project was let go. My initial prototype can be found on <a href="https://github.com/SilverIronMan/ACI-Project">my GitHub</a>
